# Samsung's Shannon Baseband Tool Repository

Scripts, tools, and information to help reverse engineer Samsung's EXYNOS cellular baseband platform, codenamed Shannon.
These tools were released for the talk ["Emulating Samsung's Shannon Baseband for Security Testing"](https://www.blackhat.com/us-20/briefings/schedule/#emulating-samsungs-baseband-for-security-testing-20564) at Black Hat USA'2020, August 5th.

## Getting started with Shannon Firmware
Here's a quick tutorial to start reversing this firmware with [GHIDRA](https://ghidra-sre.org/).

1. Download the firmware binary of choice. Make sure you have extracted the CP partition from official Samsung firmware and have further extracted the `modem.bin` file. Make sure to unlz4 the binary if it is compressed.
1. Install the ShannonLoader at the splash screen using *File* &raquo; *Install Extensions...*. Target the `ShannonLoader.zip` release that is in the latest release tag
1. Now start a new GHIDRA project and add a new file. Select the `modem.bin` file. You should see that this file's loader is automatically selected as "Samsung Shannon Modem Binary". If you do not see this, make sure that you have loaded the right file and installed the extension properly. Open GHIDRA debug console (bottom right on splash screen) to double check if there are any errors.
1. Import the file, let the loader finish and once again make sure there were no errors during loading.
1. Double click on the imported file to open CodeBrowser and hit no to auto-analysis for now.
1. Now run the `ShannonTraceEntry.py` python script from Script Manager under the "Shannon" category. Make sure to either place scripts into your user home directory at `~/ghidra_scripts` (Linux) or add the path to them in the manager. This script will identify all trace debugging information before analysis and avoid diassembling data.
1. Go to *Analysis* &raquo; *Auto analyze...*, and **uncheck the "Non-returning Functions - Discovered" analyzer** as this causes broken recovery of the `log_printf` function, leading to broken disassembly throughout the binary. If you do not uncheck this, you will need to restart your import from scratch.
1. Hit analyze and let GHIDRA churn away until it settles.
1. Next optionally run the auto-renamer script, `ShannonRename.py`. This will help you navigate the binary, but is far from perfect and leads to duplicate names (okay in GHIDRA, but not in IDA).
1. Start reversing!

If you want a quick look around, [we exported a GHIDRA project for a 2017 modem image](https://mega.nz/file/S04TWSLD#9fUma__iIz4mpvGlTRnDjCfm7hjUo9IIpirx51-CqjY).

## Testing
The loader and scripts have been QA'd to work with Ghidra 9.1.2 and many of the firmware images included in the `firmware/` section of this repo.

Some known issues include the loader not being able to find certain memory patterns on 5G baseband images (due to large architectural changes).
Please report or open a pull request for any exceptions or other errors so we can improve the tooling across firmware and Ghidra versions.
